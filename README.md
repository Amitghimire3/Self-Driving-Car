# Self-Driving-Car
This project demonstrates the development of a self-driving car simulation using JavaScript.
The car uses a neural network to navigate roads and avoid obstacles. The simulation shows the behaviour of a self-driving car and its decision-making process based on sensors and road conditions.

#Features
Neural Network: Trains a neural network to control the car's movements based on inputs like the road and sensor data.
Sensors: Detects obstacles and road conditions to make real-time decisions.
Visualizer: Displays the car's movement and surroundings for better understanding of the simulation.
